## Common Starting Point for Recipes

Ultimately, this cookbook is meant for *development* to learn how to do something in reagent.  With that in mind, I created a very minimal starting point called [reagent-cookbook-template](https://github.com/gadfly361/reagent-cookbook-template).  The intent of each recipe should be easy to follow and can be implemented with other reagent templates, such as [reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template) or [reagent-seed](https://github.com/gadfly361/reagent-seed), etc.
