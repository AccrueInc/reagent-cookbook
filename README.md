The goal of this repo is to provide recipes for how to accomplish specific tasks in a [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) webapp.

## Common Starting Point for Recipes

The starting point for reagent-cookbook recipes is [reagent-cookbook-template](https://github.com/gadfly361/reagent-cookbook-template).

```
$ lein new rc <app-name>
```

The template includes the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    <script>app_name.core.main();</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```clojure
(defproject app-name "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [org.clojure/clojurescript "1.8.51"]
                 [reagent "0.6.0-rc"]]

  :source-paths ["src/clj"]

  :plugins [[lein-cljsbuild "1.1.3"]
            [lein-figwheel "0.5.4-7"]]

  :clean-targets ^{:protect false} ["resources/public/js" "target"]

  :cljsbuild
  {:builds
   [{:id           "dev"
     :source-paths ["src/cljs"]
     :figwheel     {:on-jsload "app-name.core/reload"}
     :compiler     {:main                 app-name.core
                    :output-to            "resources/public/js/app.js"
                    :output-dir           "resources/public/js/out"
                    :asset-path           "js/out"
                    :source-map-timestamp true}}

    {:id           "prod"
     :source-paths ["src/cljs"]
     :compiler     {:output-to     "resources/public/js/app.js"
                    :optimizations :advanced
                    :pretty-print  false}}]})
```

```clojure
(ns app-name.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]))


(defonce app-state
  (reagent/atom {}))


(defn page [ratom]
  [:div
   [:h1 "Reagent Cookbook Template"]
   ])


(defn reload []
  (reagent/render [page app-state]
                  (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(defn ^:export main []
  (reload))
```
